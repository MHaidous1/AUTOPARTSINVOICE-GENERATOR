# AUTOPARTSINVOICE-GENERATOR
This is a Java program that creates an invoice for a customer's purchase of products from an auto parts store. It includes four classes: MainAppClass, AddressClass, InvoiceClass, LineItemClass, and ProductClass.

MainAppClass includes the main method that runs the program, prompts the user to enter information about the products, creates objects of the other classes, and calls methods to calculate and display the invoice.

AddressClass is a class that stores the store's address information and has a toString method that returns a formatted address string.

InvoiceClass is a class that stores an array list of LineItemClass objects and has methods to add new items to the array list, calculate the total price of all items, and display the invoice.

LineItemClass is a class that stores the quantity and product information for each item on the invoice, and has methods to calculate and return the total price for that item.

ProductClass is a class that stores the description and price for each product and has getter and setter methods for those variables.
